Hello there, I'm Marc.

I've had plenty of personal websites over the years. Still, I could never hold an interest in keeping a personal blog updated. I'm not much of a "blogger" if you will, nor have I ever been a grammar enthusiast, so keep that in mind.

Now, with that being said, as time goes on and the older I get, I'm starting to realize that memories are very important. One day in the far future, I'm going to want to relive some of my past experiences, or even look through my old projects on GitHub. Unfortunately, I regret not anticipating wanting to revisit some of my old projects in the past, so a lot of them are just gone for good.

For example, my very first "big boy" project was an application called SpyLink. It was just a simple [URL shortener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening) that also logged the visitor's information, such as their IP Address, browser details, and location data. I was so proud of that application. I built it years before any decent frameworks were out, and I was probably 12 or 13 years old when I created it. I eventually turned it into a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (before SaaS was a thing) and made around $300 before I just lost interest in it and started working on something else. I was never in it for the money, unfortunately. I wish I was now that I'm old and wise(er)(ish).

What I would give to travel back in time and relive that moment, or hell, just having the ability to explore the source code would be amazing! When I sit back and think about how many wonderful experiences I've had throughout my life that I can not recall, not just with my projects but with life in general, it hurts my soul. I have a family now, a girlfriend, kids, career, all of that needs to be backed up somewhere so my old brain doesn't forget it.

Well, the solution to that is this blog. Now, as I've said before, keeping up with a blog isn't going to be easy for me. On top of having issues with sharing my life with the world (which who am I kidding, no one is reading this), I have issues with perfection. I am a huge perfectionist, and I dread it. A lot of my past projects have been tossed down the drain because it wasn't perfect. A lot of my past experiences have been tossed because it wasn't perfect. So in my mind, this blog needs to be perfect, my grammar needs to be perfect, my ability to tell a story needs to be perfect, or I will want to throw it away. I can't do that anymore. I'm not perfect, I will never be perfect, so if I just keep that mindset, maybe it will help?

Anyway, I feel like I'm getting too dramatic, especially for my very first post. It's not that serious, so let's switch it up a bit. Let's talk about what this blog is about (which is where I wanted to go with this post).

So, when I decided to start a blog, I started figuring out which [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) I wanted to use. Long story short, I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which isn't really a CMS at all, but a lot of developers were using it, so I gave it a shot.

After the install, instead of designing my own theme, I thought I would start with a pre-built, then design my own later on. Well, I came across a theme called [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please). I fell in love with the minimalistic feel of it and loved how [Riggraz](https://riggraz.dev/) (the designer) was using it on his blog. While I was checking out his blog, getting the feel for the theme, I came across his very first post, "[what this blog is](https://riggraz.dev/intro.html)."

Reading that post, it amazed me how similar we are to each other. His insecurities and perfectionism screamed "[imposter syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQUxL4Jm1Lo)" which I've been unsolicitedly diagnosed with my entire life. I almost felt like I knew this dude, just from reading a few words on the screen. I say imposter syndrome because he's worried about not having good content on his blog, but got someone like me with the attention span of a goldfish to read just about every post of his.

Anyway, I love it. I love his content and especially his theme. At the moment, that's what I'm using now, but I've made quite a few changes. But the entire inspiration of this blog is because of Riggraz, so if by any chance you're reading this, thank you. You've really inspired me to hit the ground running and carry the momentum to continue with this.

I'm trying really hard not to plagiarize your blog, so hopefully you don't feel that way, but I did read your [GitHub Arctic Vault, Code and Memory](https://riggraz.dev/code-and-memory.html) post and was stoked to learn that I am in fact an [Arctic Code Vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o) Contributor as well, so that may be my second post too. lol

It feels wrong, but I promise to switch it up soon!

Anywho, I'm really excited to see what this blog turns into. I'm still deciding on whether or not I need to switch to WordPress, solely because there will come a day when I want to make a post via my phone, but that hurdle can wait for its own jump rope.

But that's all for now. See ya next time!
